# create the following:

# while loop to print 'Hello World' 10 times
# we'd usually use a for loop for this (next lesson)
print('Hello World 10 times:')


 
# while loop dependant on user input 
# print the number the user enters until they input 0
print("\nLet's print your numbers")




# while loop to get user input until it matches 'run' or 'hide'
